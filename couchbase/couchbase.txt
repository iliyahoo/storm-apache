# The maximal value of the replica number in couchbase is 3
# Each node has its data replicated to 3 other nodes, so you could handle 3 node failures in your cluster.
# optionally create replica indexes on nodes that are contain replicated data; this is to prepare your cluster for a failover scenario

# Otimization:
  CPU:
    min 4 cores
    + 1 core for design document
    + 1 core per XDCR replicated bucket
      XDCR = cross data center replication

  Disk:
    multiple EBS volumes High IOPS Raid 0 on Amazon
    use different file systems for databases and indices

  RAM:
    OS memory (recomended ~ 60%)
    Metadata: (64 bytes + key_length) * all_documents
    Document Values: NRU ejected if RAM Quota Used > 90%
      NRU = not recently used
    Use Value eviction: consumes more memory but provides the best performance
